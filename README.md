# Sudoku solver using Algorithm X

This is a script written in Haskell that uses [Algorthim X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) to solve a sudoku puzzle 9x9.
The script contains functions to generate a sudoku, [an exact cover matrix](https://www.stolaf.edu//people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm) based on the sudoku puzzle where unsolved cells are replaced with null and algorithm X implementation.

See the file header for more information about using the script.
